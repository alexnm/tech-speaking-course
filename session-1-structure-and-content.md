## Why do we speak at conferences?
* you are building an idea in their mind
* 1 talk = 1 main idea you want to send

Always ask yourself the following questions:
* what’s the key takeaway?
* what matters to you vs what matters to others? (make them care)
* what is your unique perspective?

## Structure
### The through-line
The single line that connects all your ideas into a fluent story

Start your talk preparation by thinking about the structure:
* sketch on paper (ideas, arrows, flow) or in slides (basic)
* make it linear, one thing leads to another, don't shift attention to another topic
* a highpoint always works nicely (ex: a working demo, announcing something new, challenging the mind of the audience)
* order is important, be careful with how you introduce new concepts

### Sections
Always work nice and build the bigger picture in the mind of the audience. There's no single recipe for how to structure your sections or how to split them up. It's nice to add some creatitivity to the mix.
* split in sections at the beginning, but allow room to play with this
* transitions between sections are important (we'll see more at slide design)
* announce your intentions: "I want to give you 3 things today", "this story has 4 parts", etc.
* you have to love every part and be passionate about it, if not drop it

### Key Takeaway and closure
* coming back to the key idea
* make sure you have a good closure with impact (a call to arms, emphasis of the key point, a thought-provoking idea)

## Content
### Establish the context
* who is the audience (students, juniors, seniors, management, business)
* how is the conference like (check prev years)
* who else is talking there (graphql example)
    
### Keep it simple
* Use simple explanations
* Position yourself according to the audience, but never assume something is known/understood
* You don’t have to look smarter than the audience, they already have that in mind

### Language and Humor
* Simple language, don't use too much slang or technical jargon
* Swearing on stage and in general in public speaking is a double edge sword, make sure you speak in your natural way
* Humor - different cultures understand things differently, make you you are not making offensive jokes
* Tone according to the message, you have to let your natural self do the work (funny/serious)

## Telling a story
Use stories and personal references to break the standards:
* add a personal touch
* tell us something memorable
* avoid the 100% technical presentation
* a good story is your shot at grabbing my attention

Stories can be added at the beginning (they can set the context) or throughout the talk (they can be like a journey through the talk). Stories can circle back to the idea behind the talk, turning the idea into inspiration for others.
