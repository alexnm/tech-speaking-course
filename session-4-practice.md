## How much should you prepare

be fully prepared, when you are fully prepared, you are at your best, you can focus on other things

### Make your own preparation process
* start a few weeks/months in advance
* preferably go short slots every day / few days
* make breaks (one day, week) and come back to see how it looks
* prepare by talking, not by repeating in your head
* sync your slides with your talk (revealing slides in language before you show them)
* speed and timing are important in a later stage
* Refine your talk while preparing
    * write thoughts (improve as you prepare) and phrases you come up with
    * detective mode, find the holes, missing links
    * something doesnâ€™t sound right? drop it
    * something is a maybe? drop it
    * something worth adding? do it

### Scripted Talks
* you memorize the whole content
* you fallback to your notes
* if you want to memorize, go all the way, not half measured
* make sure you keep a natural flow to your speech, otherwise it sounds bad

### Unscripted Talks
* unscripted is not unprepared
* rehearse key parts
* each talk will be a different experience

### Focus while rehearsing
* First 5 minutes or the first 15-20% of the talk, depending on the length
* Are you preparing a demo?
    * rehearse it well
    * be prepared with backups (offline, video recordings)
* Are you moving outside the slides?
    * make sure you come back with full screen
