## The purpose of slides

### What slides are NOT
* Your content
* Your speaking notes
* Your go to resource during the talk

Rule of thumb: I shouldn't be able to understand your talk by looking only at the slides

### What slides are
* Your visual (and also audio at times) support during the talk
* Another channel through which you communicate with your audience
* Your way of emphasizing and drawing attention on key points from your talk

## Side Design
First you need to decide if you want to do a dark background or light background design. It always depends on the room setup and whether you are presenting on a projector or a led display.

### Typography and Contrast
* Think of people with low vision or color blindness
* Add custom typography to give a unique flare
* Think about the font size, set a minimum, make it bigger :)

### Think about the audience
* Cognitive load can be huge during the talk, make it easy for them to follow
* You should say more than what is visible on the slides
* Transition your content so the audience does not read in advance
* Test how your slides look in low contrast environments and from far away

### Images are powerful
* Slides paint the story, so use powerful images
* Images can serve as a visual representation or can transmit a message/emotion

### The slides are your playground
* Animate
* Emphasize (cross-out words, change colors, bold)
* Reveal one concept at once, preferably while you are talking about it

### Things that don't matter
* How many slides you have
* The tool that you are using
* The final format of the slides (online, offline, etc.)

## Slide Types

### Text
* One word / phrase
* Quote (text + author)
* Enumeration (make sure you show one element at a time)
* Title/Section - use a different color/element to signal a new chapter to the audience

### Image/Video
* Use full screen, don't cut with borders
* Use black paddings if needed

### Diagram/Table
* Use a lot of animations / show one thing at a time
* Make the audience follow your logic as you are describing a process / model / technical solution

### Code
* Don't show all the code, use comments to eliminate irrelevant parts
* Highlight certain lines of code as you're talking (some tools can help with this)

### Presentation / Intro
* Here you can put as much information as you wish
* Make a template that you can reuse in all your talks

## Dos and Donts (+ vs -)
+ put a black/white/neutral background color while you talk and there's nothing relevant to show
+ 16:9 ratio!
- company/conf slides, try not to use them :)
+ show the audience what to focus on, one thing at a time
- don't use explosions, vortexes and other fancy transitions just for the sake of it
+ keep a consistent flow and similar transitions
- don't add unnecessary elements / details (eg: pagination, conf name, talk title)
- small text / bad contrast
+ 3 font sizes at most (minimum should be visible from far away)
+ shorter versions for links
- don't add explanatory text when an image is enough to convey meaning
+ use semi-opaque backgrounds for text when shown over images
- don't use images with watermarks
+ give image credit if needed, below, in small text
- don't use excessive gifs, but this one depends on the context

## Homework
* Design a set of slides (4-5-6) starting from your talk idea
* Look for an older slidedeck that you have and try to apply some practices you learned
