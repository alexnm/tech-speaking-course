## Voice

Everyone has a unique voice, a combination of pitch, resonance, intonation, volume, etc.
You won't like your voice, it's just psychological, get over it :)

### Common Pitfalls
* "aaaaaa", "eeeeee", etc. - speak slower to fix it
* monotonous voice - add inflection and emphasis
* lack of emotion or passion
* speed (either too slow or too fast)

NOTE: Record yourself as often as you can while practicing and try to correct your voice as you go.

### Exercises
* With a pen in your mouth to focus on clear pronounciation
* Also for pronounciation, in Romanian: X, O, X, O, etc.
* Lift your head if you speak through the nose
* Tons of lips and jaw exercises to practice on

## Fighting Anxiety
85% of people have it, 15% lie about it
* manage your emotions, don't suppress them
* turn anxiety into excitement
* people want you to succeed, they will cheer for you
* turn the talk into a conversation, speak at the audience, they are THERE
* you should be there, not in the future, stressing about your talk / next slide, etc.
* knowing what you are talking about helps A LOT, even if you have some hicups along the way

### Passion and Confidence
* if you’re not passionate, people won’t be
* relax and have fun, enjoy your time on stage and show confidence
* you have one thing to focus on, your speaking part
