## Thereâ€™s no one way to do the talk, build your trademark

### Before going on stage
* Have everything ready / backed up (wifi connection, cached, offline, etc.)
* power posing
* drink water, eat, exercise, adrenaline
* warm up your voice (tongue twister)
* get familiar with the stage and venue
* be in speaking mode, not reading mode

### Going on stage
* introduce yourself with passion
* sync with the event
    * how was the conference so far?
    * how was the speaker before you?
    * can you improvise some stuff on the spot?
    * change slides to reflect the connection between your talk and others
* make them curious (tease the revelation)
* don't play your ace(s) from the first hand

### As the talk progresses
* make sure you keep eye contact
* your body is not there to transport your head
* remember to breathe!
* drink water if needed
* position on stage: teaching vs preaching
* interact with the audience

### Closing
* references, summary
* circularity is nice
* also, call to arms
* don't be rigid
* end on a high note
